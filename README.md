## üöÄ Deploy Your Own
This repository is a fully customized [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io) site deployed to Vercel. While Docusaurus can be deployed with zero configuration, **this project includes extensive modifications** tailored to the AUEB Drama Club's needs ‚Äî including custom components, styling, and content architecture.

If you'd like to build upon this project, you can deploy your own copy to Vercel:

### How We Got Started
We originally bootstrapped the project using the [Docusaurus CLI](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/installation#scaffold-project-website):

```shell
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

From there, the project was extensively modified to reflect the design, content, and branding needs of the theater.aueb.gr site.
