## 🚀 Deploy Your Own
This repository is a fully customized [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io) site deployed to Vercel. While Docusaurus can be deployed with zero configuration, **this project includes extensive modifications** tailored to the AUEB Drama Club's needs — including custom components, styling, and content architecture.

If you'd like to build upon this project, you can deploy your own copy to Vercel:

### How We Got Started
We originally bootstrapped the project using the [Docusaurus CLI](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/installation#scaffold-project-website):

```shell
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

From there, the project was extensively modified to reflect the design, content, and branding needs of the theater.aueb.gr site.
